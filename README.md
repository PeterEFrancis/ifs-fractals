# ifs-fractals

This is a web app for experimenting with and creating fractals that are fixed points of iterated function systems (ifs).

<!--
The goals and sections are outlined below.

#### About
Provide a rich info hub for all things ifs, including links to other resources and papers, and a detailed explanation of all of the parts of the website.

#### Playground
An interactive page where users can explicitly write transformations and specify fractal image properties such as the number of points to be used, and then view the fractal produced in real-time (with a play/pause and a zoom feature). Also included will be the ability to define variables and sliders for those variables to see how the fractal produced is affected. An upload and download section will make it easy for users to share images and data related to their fractals.

#### Transformation Maker
An interactive page that allows users to draw and edit the "block" generating-transformations for a fractal. In real time, the actual fractal image will update and the drawn transformations will be decomposed into basis transformations. (Link to the *About* page with proof that every transformations CAN be decomposed as such).

#### Machine Learning Experiment
This is the user interface to an experiment whose goal is to discover key properties of certain ifs that tend to produce "pretty" fractal images. This study presumably requires a lot of data in the form of fractal images along with their generating transformations and a rating of its attractiveness.

#### Batch Production
This page will allow a large number of ifs generating functions to be read and optionally displayed before their information and images are all downloaded.

#### Word Fractal Generator
This is just fun: users can type a word and view that word as a fractal. (I already did all of the real work for this).

#### Animation Maker (to be done if there is extra time)
Allow the user to create animations based on either Zooming in on or chaning the generating functions for a fractal. -->
